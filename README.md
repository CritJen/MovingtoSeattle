# Moving to Seattle

This project displays heatmaps of Seattle based on selected categories and then suggests currently available rental properties. You can toggle the different categories on or off. While a category is selected any locations contained said category will be displayed as a heatmap visualization layer over the map of Seattle. You can vary the intensity of the each heatmap category using the sliders.

When you press the "Where should I live?" button 10 suggested rental listings will appear. These are currently available rentals which are located in the densest regions based on the categories currently selected.
